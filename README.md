The repository consists of the source code that runs the performance comparison between Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifier using the Census Income dataset (Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income)

The attached source code has 2 versions for reference --- VS Code and Google Colab, since the written report has highlighted the model training time differences in both environments. In essence, the code in both files are the same, and the results produced are nearly identical.
